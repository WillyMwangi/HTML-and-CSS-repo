      <p>Life is made of three types of people. Those What make things happen,those who follow what happens and those who never understand what happens. I will tell you which type I am. However, I have learnt some important lesson but first I ask a questionhat differentiates extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? That “extra” is all it takes.  I needed to put in extra effort and proof excellence in my daily tasks. I started the day with some exercise, jogging around the estate to prepare my body for the tasks of the day. I have not heard of a mental gym but Andela boot camp should be considered for the title. I was operating on a code treadmill operating at a speed that was very uncomfortable. However, I had support and encouragement from my fellow boot campers and my facilitator. The tasks to complete by the end of day were not a walk in the park..</p>

      <p>I will be around this planet called earth for a short while. My days are numbered but I make the best use of every opportunity that come my way. 
      <q>God created me special, intelligent and awesome. It will be unfair if I hide it from people.
